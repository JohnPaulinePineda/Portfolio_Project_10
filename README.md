This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_10/) implements various predictive modelling procedures for dichotomous categorical responses. Models applied in the analysis to predict dichotomous categorical responses included the Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Flexible Discriminant Analysis, Mixture Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, Nearest Shrunken Centroids, Averaged Neural Network, Support Vector Machine (Radial Basis Function Kernel, Polynomial Kernel), K-Nearest Neighbors, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Conditional Inference Trees, C5.0 Decision Trees, Random Forest and Bagged Trees algorithms. The resulting predictions derived from the candidate models were evaluated in terms of their discrimination power using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) metric.
